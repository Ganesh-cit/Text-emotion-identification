# Text-emotion-identification
## Emotion Identification using NLP and Deep Learning
### Overview

This project focuses on identifying emotions from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. It includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enables users to input text and receive real-time emotion predictions. This makes it user-friendly and accessible for various applications like sentiment analysis, chatbot enhancement, and mental health monitoring.

### Features

• User-friendly GUI for real-time emotion detection

• Text preprocessing using tokenization and padding

• Deep learning-based emotion classification using TensorFlow and Keras

• Train-test split and label encoding for optimized learning

• Embedding layer to improve feature representation

• Model evaluation on a labeled dataset

### Technologies Used
Backend: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn

Frontend (GUI): Tkinter

Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

### Usage

1.Install dependencies:

*pip install keras tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn tkinter*

2.Run the GUI application

3.Enter text in the input field and get an instant emotion prediction

### Future Improvements

Enhancing GUI with better UI/UX (using PyQt or web-based frameworks)

Implementing advanced NLP models (BERT, LSTMs) for higher accuracy

Deploying as a web application or mobile app
