# Text-emotion-identification
Emotion Identification using NLP and Deep Learning
Overview
This project focuses on identifying emotions from text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques. It includes a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that enables users to input text and receive real-time emotion predictions. This makes it user-friendly and accessible for various applications like sentiment analysis, chatbot enhancement, and mental health monitoring.

Features
User-friendly GUI for real-time emotion detection
Text preprocessing using tokenization and padding
Deep learning-based emotion classification using TensorFlow and Keras
Train-test split and label encoding for optimized learning
Embedding layer to improve feature representation
Model evaluation on a labeled dataset
Technologies Used
Backend: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn
Frontend (GUI): Tkinter / PyQt (mention the framework you used)
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Usage
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install keras tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn tkinter
Run the GUI application:
bash
Copy
Edit
python gui.py  # Replace with the actual script name
Enter text in the input field and get an instant emotion prediction
Future Improvements
Enhancing GUI with better UI/UX (using PyQt or web-based frameworks)
Implementing advanced NLP models (BERT, LSTMs) for higher accuracy
Deploying as a web application or mobile app
